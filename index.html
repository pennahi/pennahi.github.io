    <p class ="color-example"> I really like colors! They make earth a brighter place!</p>
    <p class ="color-example"> I like colorful flowers and I often pick flowers with a certain color theme at a time.</p>

<ul class = "list-example"> 
    <li>Sunflowers are yellow</li> 
    <li>Roses can be almost any color, but I like the red ones the most</li>
    <li>Wood anemones are white and they are a sign of spring here</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-example">Sometimes I buy cut flowers from the store, <br> but I can't keep any actual house plant flowers alive </p>
<p class="text-example">But typical greener house plants survive well. <br> I don't know what's up with those. </p>
