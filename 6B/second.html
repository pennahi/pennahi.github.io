        <h2>Info on Puuter</h2>
        <p>Puter was a stray who had kittens when she was captured. <br>She originally came to live with her human through fostering, but as the kittens got old enough to be adopted, she stayed behind and her human decided to adopt her from P채ij채t-H채meen El채insuojeluyhdistys (PHESY). </p>
